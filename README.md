# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I'm Sam. I'm a passionate entrepreneur and software professional living in the SF Bay Area. I'm here on Github building stuff like [Elide](https://github.com/elide-dev/elide), a modern
polyglot runtime which Makes Software Fun Again.

## Drop me a line

If you're interested in collaborating or chatting, email me at sam at elide (dot) dev, or [join the É´á´œÊŸÊŸclub Discord](https://elide.dev/discord), where you can find me in the `#elide` or `#general` rooms.

# Current projects

## buildless

We've launched [Buildless](https://less.build) in private beta ðŸŽ‰. It's a remote build cache, backed by the power of Cloudflare. If you use Gradle, Maven, CCache, Bazel, Turbo, or several other build systems, you can drop in Buildless as a remote cache and share compiled outputs with your friends. Use Buildless from Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, Rust, C/C++, and more. Buildless is part of the Elide Cloud family of devops tools.

## pkgst

[Pkgst](https://docs.less.build/docs/pkgst) is a caching dependency proxy built in partnership with [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com). It can accelerate your dependency downloads from Maven, NPM, PyPi, BCR, and more.

## elide

[Elide](https://elide.dev) is a new polyglot software runtime. You can write programs in any mix of JVM (Kotlin, Java), JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Ruby, LLVM, and WASM. Elide lets you re-use more code than before and, in many cases, outperforms equivalent stock runtimes (in some cases by up to 74x).

#### Lost to the sands of time

Some of these PRs are now obsolete or were never merged, but they are lovely nonetheless.

- [`rules_buf`](https://github.com/sgammon/rules_buf): Use [Buf](https://buf.build) from your [Bazel](https://bazel.build) build.

- [`canteen`](https://github.com/sgammon/canteen): Python framework which "holds a little bit more water than a Flask." Includes a nice DSL for graph-style in-memory databasing on top of Redis.

- [Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler): I contributed a [GraalVM native image](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/pull/3958) of Closure which accelerated JS builds up to 70%
