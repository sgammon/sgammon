# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

I'm Sam. I'm a passionate entrepreneur and software professional living in the SF Bay Area. I'm here on Github building stuff like [Elide](https://github.com/elide-dev/elide), a modern
polyglot runtime which makes software fun again.


## buildless

We've launched [Buildless](https://less.build) in private beta ðŸŽ‰. It's a remote build cache, backed by the power of Cloudflare. If you use Gradle, Maven, CCache, Bazel, Turbo, or several other build systems, you can drop in Buildless as a remote cache and share compiled outputs with your friends.
